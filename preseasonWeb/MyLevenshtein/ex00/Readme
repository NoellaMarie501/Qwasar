# Welcome to My Levenshtein
My Levenshtein is a function that takes two strings and ompares them reurning their difference in a numeric value

## Task
The problem was to compare two strings and give their differences in numbers 

## Description
I created a function that takes the two strings as arguments and then creates an array of each string and then co√∂pares the values of the two arrays if they are equal
